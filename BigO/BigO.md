# Big-O Notation
Big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requriements grow as the input size grows. Big O notation is a fuzzy word. Because we can't actually pinpoint the complexity of an algorithm rather we assume a complexity. There are two types of complexity - 

- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity 

### Space Complexity
**Space complexity** is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs. That means how much memory, in the worst case, is needed at any point in the algorithm. As with the time complexity, we're mostly concerned with how the space needs to grow, in Big-Oh terms as the size of N (input) grows.

### Time Complexity 
**Time complexity** means how an algorithm acts or how much an algorithm takes time in proportion to the input element grows. In porgramming language, its a computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. 

### The Most Common Run Time Complexity
- O(1) Constant Run Time 
- O(n) Linear Run Time 
- O(n^2) Quadratic Run Time 
- O(log n) Logarithmic Run Time
- O(n log n) Linearithmic Run Time 
- O(2^n) Exponential Run Time 
- O(n!) Factorial Run Time
