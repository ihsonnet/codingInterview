## Question: A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8(that is , not byte will split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y). The method signature should look something like: `drawline(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y)`

We can solve this problem in JavaScript and C++.
