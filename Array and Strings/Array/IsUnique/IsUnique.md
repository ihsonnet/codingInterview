## Question: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. 

We can solve this problem using JavaScript. We make a function called `isUnique` which has one parameter named `inputString` to take the string. In the function we make an empty object named `obj`. Now we will traverse through the entire given string (`inputString`)using `for` loop. For each iteration we store each character in the `ch` variable (`let ch = inputString[i]`) and check if the `obj` object has the character in it. If it exists then return false. If it is not then set the character to `obj` to true. It means if the object `obj` has similar character then return false and if the object `obj` doesn't have the similar character then return true. After the for loop we returns true. 

#### Runtime complexity
This algorithm has **O(n) Linear Runtime Complexity** as it has one loop to traverse through the string. `n` is the given string. For worst case scenario the loop will go through the whole length of the string. So the ultimate runtime complexity is O(n).
