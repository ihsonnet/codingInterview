## Question: Implement a method to perform basic string comression using the counts to repeated character. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method sould return the original string. You can assuem the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters.

To solve this problem we make a function which takes one parameter `givenString`. Now, we take a variable `str` and initiate it with empty string, another variable `count` to count the occurrence of the character. <br>
